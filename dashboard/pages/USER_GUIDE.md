# Donut Shop Analytics Dashboard - User Documentation

Welcome to the Donut Shop Analytics Dashboard. This application is built to provide comprehensive insights into retail sales performance, inventory tracking, financial metrics, and human resource management.

---

## Architecture Overview

The application processes data across multiple relational database schemas:
* **Sales Schema:** Manages transactional records and purchase items (`sales`, `sale_items`).
* **Inventory Schema:** Handles product catalog, recipes, stock levels, waste logs, and procurement (`categories`, `donuts`, `donut_ingreds`, `ingredients`, `ingred_stock`, `waste_logs`, `purchases`, `suppliers`).
* **HR Schema:** Stores organizational structure, employee profiles, shift schedules, and payroll histories (`employees`, `job_roles`, `shifts`, `payments_history`).

## Global Navigation and Layout Standard

Each core operational page in this dashboard follows a unified layout design:
1. **Global Data Refresh:** A top-level refresh button allowing users to clear execution cache and load the latest records directly from the database.
2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** High-level summary metrics positioned at the top of each module.
3. **Structured Views:** A tabbed interface dividing information into:
   * **Tables Tab:** Filterable and detailed tabular representations of raw/aggregated data.
   * **Charts Tab:** Interactive graphical visualizations for trend analysis and comparative studies.
